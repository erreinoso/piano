# Piano Keyboard ðŸŽµ

Today, I felt like I wanted to play piano using CSS and JavaScript ðŸ˜Ž

Why not joining things that i love to do, like web develpment and playing music?

The better way to play the piano is having in mind the music notation system.

C - Do <br>
D - Re<br>
E - Mi<br>
F - Fa<br>
G - Sol<br>
A - La<br>
B - Si<br>

You can also use your mouse.
